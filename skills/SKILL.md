  Use when working in a project that uses specification-driven development.
  Start from specs/overview.md and specs/ctx.md, treat specs as the active
  task context, keep ctx.md concise and decision-relevant, route content to
  its right home (changelog/roadmap/ideas/overview), address user remarks
  marked with ^^^ and answer with &&&. Drive task files in specs/tasks/
  through the specdev CLI (task new/advance/scope/done, check) instead of
  editing their state by hand. Trigger when the user asks to work on specs,
  continue from specs, pick up or create a task, address remarks, compress
  specs, or when entering a project with a specs/ directory.
---

Teaches the agent to work with project specs as the primary planning, coordination, and memory surface. Specs are Markdown files in a `specs/` directory. The agent reads them, updates them, and uses them as context before writing code. The `specdev` CLI owns the structured parts (task state, logs, indexes) and checks everything; the agent owns the prose.

## Invariants

Hold these at all times. They exist because agents silently drift on exactly these points.

- **Task identity is immutable by default.** The `ctx.md` title and a task file's `# Task:` title name the work. Don't rename, narrow, replace, or archive without explicit user intent.
- **Never bulk-replace an active `ctx.md` or task file.** Make the smallest surgical edit that achieves the change.
- **Archival requires explicit intent.** All steps done is necessary, not sufficient.
- **Preserve decision-relevant state.** "Concise" means concise and decision-relevant, not minimal.
- **Structured state goes through commands.** Never hand-edit task frontmatter, the `## Log` section, or `specs/tasks/_index.md`. `specdev check` detects hand edits from the task's own log and fails.

## Session startup

When entering a project, or when the user says "continue from specs":

1. Read `specs/overview.md` (durable project backdrop + gotchas).
2. Read `specs/ctx.md` (the current focus). If it points at a task file, read that file and run `specdev task show <id>` for its state and next step.
3. Run `specdev check` to see what is broken or drifting before you change anything.
4. If there is no active work (`ctx.md` is just the `# Current Task Context` header and no task is in progress), ask the user what to do, or take the next item from `specs/roadmap.md` or the task queue (`specdev task list`). The header-only state is valid, not an error.
5. Read `specs/ideas.md` only for brainstorming or roadmap work, or when `ctx.md` points there. Don't read `specs/cleanup.md` unless the user asks.
6. Identify any `^^^` remarks in relevant specs (see below).

## Content routing — put each thing in its right home

Content is routed by *when* it lives. This keeps `ctx.md` and task files clean.

- **`specs/ctx.md`** — the current focus: a pointer to the active task file, or a design/fuzzy task with its own checkbox plan.
- **`specs/tasks/<id>.md`** — one task, sized to land as one commit: plan, scope, acceptance, review, log.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** (root) — finished work. `specdev task done` writes entries for task files; ctx tasks are moved here by hand under the archival gate.
- **`specs/roadmap.md`** — committed future direction.
- **`specs/ideas.md`** — noted but not-now ideas.
- **`specs/overview.md`** — architecture, data flow, durable knowledge, gotchas and quirks.
- **`specs/cleanup.md`** — code smells and refactors spotted.

`CHANGELOG.md` and `AGENTS.md` live at the project root, not under `specs/`. Content routing does not expand the user's edit scope: if the user limits edits to named files, record follow-ups in the active task and leave other files untouched.

**Forbidden inside `ctx.md`:** `Deferred` sections, `Roadmap pointer` lines, `Gotchas`/`Quirks` blocks, architecture essays, and "completed work is not repeated here" meta-notes. Route them to their home instead.

## The working loop

Content matures in one direction, then archives: `ideas.md` (uncommitted) → `roadmap.md` (committed) → `ctx.md` or `specs/tasks/` (active) → `CHANGELOG.md` (done).

- An idea moves to `roadmap.md` when decided; a roadmap item becomes active work when picked up.
- Small, well-defined work (one commit) becomes a **task file** and runs through the task pipeline below. A roadmap item bigger than one commit is split into several task files ordered by `depends`.
- Design work and big, fuzzy work run directly in **`ctx.md`** with a checkbox plan.
- When nothing is active, the next item comes from `roadmap.md` or the task queue.

## ctx.md — the current focus (soft template)

`ctx.md` is **concise and decision-relevant, not minimal**. Recommended shape:

```md
# Current Task Context: <one line>
State: <not started | in progress | blocked>
## Plan
- [ ] step one
- [ ] step two
## Findings      # optional — concise research/results when the next step is evaluate/discuss
## Context
<what the current unchecked step needs; or: "Active task: specs/tasks/0007-slug.md">
## Next
<the immediate next action>
```

- The file always starts with `# Current Task Context`; append `: <task>` when work is active. The header **is the task identity**. The no-task state is header-only.
- When the work is a task file, keep `ctx.md` to the one-line focus plus a pointer to `specs/tasks/<id>.md`; the plan lives in the task file. specdev never writes `ctx.md`; `check` warns when it points at a task that isn't active.
- `## Plan` steps are children, not the task: completing one is never permission to reset or archive.
- `## Findings` (optional): compact research, decisions, results. Never delete without explicit reset intent.
- Tick boxes (`[ ]` -> `[x]`) as you implement, with surgical edits.

## Task files and the pipeline

A task file is `specs/tasks/<id>.md`: flat-YAML frontmatter (owned by specdev), a Markdown body (yours), and a `## Log` at the end (owned by specdev). The contract (required sections, extra fields, attempts cap, acceptance defaults, quality limits) is in `specdev.toml`.

# Task: warn when ctx.md is stale while in progress

## Plan            checkboxes — the steps
## Acceptance      checkboxes — commands you run at verify
## Manual checks   optional checkboxes — human e2e steps at approval
## Summary         one line — becomes the CHANGELOG entry
## Context / Findings / Review / Spec updates   optional
## Log             specdev only
```

**Who owns what:**

- **Commands own:** `status`, `stage`, `scope`, `attempts`, `blocked_reason`, `source`, `depends`, the `## Log`, the file's location, and `_index.md`.
- **You own:** the title (set once at creation), Plan, Acceptance, Context, Findings, Review, Summary, Spec updates, and ticking Plan and Acceptance boxes.
- **The human owns:** approval, `## Manual checks` ticks, branches, the PR, and the merge. specdev never writes to git and never runs project commands.

**Stages, in order** (happy path: draft → ready → implement → verify → review → approval → done):

1. **draft** — `specdev task new <slug>`; `specdev task set <id> source "<issue or request>"`; add files with `specdev task scope <id> add <path> --reason "..."`; write Plan and Acceptance (`task new` pre-fills project defaults). The human reviews with `^^^`; you answer with `&&&`. When the human approves, compress the dialogue into the plan, then `specdev task advance <id>` → ready. It refuses while `^^^` remarks are open, and it records the approved scope.
2. **ready** — queued. `specdev task advance <id>` → in-progress/implement; refused while another task is active (one at a time).
3. **implement** — code only inside `scope`. Need another file? `specdev task scope <id> add <path> --reason "..."` *before* touching it; a large expansion means the plan was wrong — say so. Tick Plan boxes; `specdev task advance <id>` → verify (refused while Plan boxes are unticked).
4. **verify** — run every Acceptance command yourself and tick each one that passes; specdev only checks the ticks. All pass → `specdev task advance <id>` → review. Any fail → `specdev task advance <id> --to fix`.
5. **review** — judge the diff against Plan and scope (ideally a fresh session); write `## Review`. Approve → `specdev task advance <id>` → approval. Changes needed → `--to fix`.
6. **fix** — address `## Review` notes or failures; `specdev task advance <id>` → verify. Each entry into fix bumps `attempts`; past the cap the task is blocked automatically.
7. **approval** — stop here. Before handing over, write a one-line `## Summary`. The human runs `## Manual checks`, opens the PR, and merges; problems come back as `^^^` and `--to fix`.
8. **done** — after the merge, `specdev task done <id>` (the human, or you when asked): logs the move, archives to `specs/tasks/done/`, writes the CHANGELOG entry from `## Summary`, updates the index. Refused while Manual checks are unticked or the Summary is missing.

**Blocked:** `specdev task block <id> --reason "..."` from any open stage. The human decides where it goes next: `specdev task advance <id> --to <draft|ready|implement|verify|review|fix>`.

**Useful anytime:** `specdev task show <id>` (state, progress, log, next step), `specdev task list` (queue order), `specdev task index` (regenerate `_index.md`). Ids accept the full id, the number (`7`), or the slug.

## specdev check

Run `specdev check` after every state change and before handing work back. Projects can also run `specdev check --staged` as a pre-commit hook (scope violations become warnings there). Errors exit 1; warnings don't.

- **Contract:** required sections, `stage` only while in progress, `blocked_reason` only while blocked, `depends` exist, id matches the file name. Empty scope, Plan, or Acceptance is a warning in draft and an error after.
- **Log consistency** (`log-*`, `log-mismatch`): the frontmatter must equal what the `## Log` replays to. A mismatch means someone edited state by hand. Don't "repair" it by editing the log; tell the user what differs and let them decide.
- **Scope** (`out-of-scope`): changed files (from git) outside the active task's scope. Add them with `task scope add --reason`, or revert the change. Anything under `specs/` and the project's `[scope] always_allowed` globs never count.
- **Repo:** one active task (`active-tasks`), `_index.md` up to date (`index-stale` → `specdev task index`).
- **Quality** (`quality-*`, `md-table`, `ascii-diagram`): files over their line or word limits, too many plan steps, too large a scope. Act on them: split the task, route content out of `ctx.md`, compress older CHANGELOG entries.
- **Format** (`unformatted`): run `specdev fmt` rather than re-wrapping by hand.

**Refusals are the safety net.** A state command that would leave the task failing `check` refuses and prints the diagnostics ("refused: this change would make `specdev check` fail"). Fix the cause in the prose or with the right command; never work around a refusal by editing frontmatter or the log.

## CLI tools

- `specdev init` — scaffold `specs/` (overview, ctx, roadmap, ideas, cleanup, `tasks/`, `tasks/done/`), `specdev.toml`, and root `CHANGELOG.md`/`AGENTS.md` (append-aware). Safe to re-run.
- `specdev task new|list|show|index|advance|block|set|scope|done` — the task pipeline above.
- `specdev check [--staged]` — everything above.
- `specdev fmt [<file>...]` — normalize Markdown in `specs/` and open task files: soft-wrap paragraphs, `-` bullets, blank lines around headings. Code, tables, links, and `^^^`/`&&&` lines stay as written.
- `specdev scan` — `^^^`/`&&&` remarks across `specs/`, open vs resolved.
- `specdev status` — health summary: markers, ctx progress, ctx warnings.
- `specdev list [--stats]` — spec files with header and size; `--stats` adds headings, checkboxes, remarks, words, code blocks, tables.
- `specdev skill install [--local]` / `specdev skill check` — install or check this skill.
- `--format json|toon` (global) — machine-readable output for `check`, `task`, `scan`, `status`, `list`, `fmt`.

## Formatting specs

Specs are often read in a terminal editor where rendered Markdown is unavailable. Write for plain text:

- **Plain, simple English; say less.** Short sentences, common words, no filler or restating. Keep decisions, facts, and next steps; drop narration, hedging, and background the reader already has. If `check` reports `quality-words`, cut before you split.
- **No Markdown tables.** One bullet per item, key in bold: `- **verify** — run Acceptance; pass → review, fail → fix.`
- **No ASCII diagrams.** Describe flows as numbered steps; a one-line `draft → ready → done` is fine.
- **Bullets and short sections** over long paragraphs. One idea per bullet.
- **Soft wraps.** One line per paragraph or bullet; `specdev fmt` fixes hard wraps.
- **Code blocks only for literal content** — file formats, frontmatter, commands, config.
- **Shallow headings.** `##` for sections, `###` sparingly.

## Marker protocol

`^^^` and `&&&` are line-start markers used **only inside spec and task files**:

- `^^^` = user remark, question, correction, or TODO.
- `&&&` = agent answer addressing a nearby `^^^`.

Rules:

- Never write `^^^`; that marker belongs to the human. Answer with `&&&`.
- Add the `&&&` answer adjacent to its `^^^`; don't delete the `^^^` line.
- Leave a remark you can't resolve as `^^^` with no answer.
- Never use these markers in code, comments, or conversation.

## Addressing remarks

1. Read the file and find all `^^^` remarks.
2. For each, answer it with an adjacent `&&&`, or leave it open if you need the user. When a remark corrects nearby prose, update that prose too.
3. Don't start code while relevant `^^^` remarks are unresolved (for task files, `advance` enforces this at draft → ready).
4. Reply with what was addressed, what remains open, and the next step.

## Context compression

Compress only on **explicit user request** ("compress / fold / condense the `^^^`/`&&&` dialogue"). Approving a draft task counts as that request for that task file. A general "rewrite for clarity" is not.

- Fold each resolved `^^^`/`&&&` pair into the adjacent prose, removing the markers and the back-and-forth.
- Keep each decision next to the assertion it concerns; never move pairs into a detached Q&A section.
- Keep unresolved `^^^` remarks as-is, and the rest of the plan, findings, and context at their existing detail.

See `references/examples.md` for before/after examples.

## Archival

- **Task files:** `specdev task done <id>` after the human merges. That is the only way a task file finishes.
- **ctx.md tasks:** archive only when all three hold: every Plan box is `[x]`; the titled task itself (not one step) is finished; and the user explicitly asks to archive, close, or reset. `specdev status`'s archive nudge means *ask*, not archive. Then move the task into `CHANGELOG.md` as a dated block at the top, move durable findings to `overview.md` and remaining work to `roadmap.md`, and reset `ctx.md` to the header.

## Before mutating a spec

Classify the change in one line before editing:

- **tick a step** — `[ ]` -> `[x]`; nothing else.
- **update findings/context/review** — decision-relevant state for the current work.
- **task state change** — use the `specdev task …` command, never an edit.
- **add a future idea** — to `ideas.md` or `roadmap.md`.
- **compress** — fold resolved `^^^`/`&&&` dialogue into prose.
- **archive** — per "Archival".

Always ask first (never infer): renaming a task, resetting or archiving `ctx.md`, editing `CHANGELOG.md` by hand, deleting findings, compressing. Make the smallest edit: re-read the section, then patch it.

## Behavior

**Do:**

- Start with `overview.md`, `ctx.md`, and `specdev check`.
- Keep `ctx.md` concise and route other content home.
- Put one-commit work in task files and move them only with `specdev task` commands.
- Declare scope before touching a file; run the Acceptance commands yourself and tick only what passed.
- Run `specdev check` after every state change.
- Preserve user wording, `^^^`/`&&&` pairs (until compression), and open questions.

**Do not:**

- Hand-edit task frontmatter, `## Log`, or `_index.md`; move or delete task files by hand.
- Work around a refusal or a `log-mismatch` by editing state.
- Tick Acceptance boxes you didn't verify, or `## Manual checks` (the human's).
- Advance past approval yourself, or create branches, commits, or PRs unless the user asks.
- Rename, narrow, or archive the task without explicit intent; bulk-replace an active `ctx.md`.
- Delete findings or `^^^` remarks; relocate resolved pairs into a Q&A transcript.
- Put deferred items, roadmap pointers, gotchas, or architecture essays in `ctx.md`.
- Use Markdown tables or ASCII diagrams in specs.

## Gotchas

- `^^^`/`&&&` are for spec and task files only.
- `ctx.md` should represent reality; if it is stale, update it before starting.
- The no-task state (`ctx.md` header only, no active task) is valid.
- Only one task is active (in-progress or approval) at a time; `advance` refuses a second.
- `check`'s scope test reads uncommitted changes vs `HEAD`; commit each task as one commit to keep it meaningful.
- `roadmap.md` is committed direction; `ideas.md` is not. Don't blur them.
- Other spec files can use whatever structure fits; the core workflow is stable.
